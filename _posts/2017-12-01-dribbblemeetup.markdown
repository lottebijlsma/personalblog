Yesterday I took a step in a new direction. I tried to overcome my fear of public speaking at the Dribbble Meetup where I voluntarily presented some of my design work.


Speaking for an audience does not come easy to me. I've been bullied a lot in high school and because of that, I started thinking I wasn't good enough. I've always hated the presentations I had to do in front of the classroom, because I had to open up and put it all out there, but no one cared. No one was supporting. It felt like they were all secretly laughing with me and no one gave two shits.

Luckily this all changed in college. I do still get the jitters every time I have to stand in front of an audience, but now , I do think I'm good and interesting enough. I do think I deserve to share my opinion as well and this was the start of a new era for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm still self aware and sometimes insecure about myself, but so is everyone. The only thing that has changed right now is that I don't shy away from opportunities anymore. I grab them whenever I can.

So..



Thursday the 30th of November. I made my debut as a *public speaker* at the Dribbble Meetup at Cloud Studio in Ghent. Even though it was only showing off my work and talking about it for +- 5 minutes to people in the field, it still was terrifying, but I’m really glad I did it.

The Meetup itself had a real cosy atmosphere because there were only about 20 people. Gil Huybrecht did a talk about how to grow your Dribbble following and had some handy tips and tricks. And then the main act of the evening, Bram Vanhaeren, talked a little bit about his work as well, which was also very interesting and inspiring.

If you weren’t here, you missed a very intimate cosy evening full of inspiration and great people.
