Coming up with a new creative idea, a new concept or a new design is hard. But where's a will, there's a way. Here's a list of websites where I get my inspiration.


#### 1. Typewolf

Typewolf is a site that showcases different fonts in the wild. It shows how fonts _really_ look on your site, and this is often much more convenient than the standard pangrams such as *"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"* or *"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow."*. Although you have to pay for most fonts (and they're way over my budget), I use this site not only for fontspiration, but also for regular web design inspiration.

The showcased websites are often really cool and out-of-the-box. Killing two birds with one stone!


#### 2. Open Foundry

The Hot 30 by *Open Foundry* is a collection of well known and [mostly] lesser known open-source fonts. This means that the fonts are distributed under an open-source license, which means they're free.

I have found a number of cool and appropriate fonts here, myself. For example "Young Serif" by Uplaod. I used this font for my astral projection app, because I really thought it fit and supported the Scandinavian atmosphere, where I went for. Certainly take a look at this site if you're looking for new fonts or if you're just a font geek, like me ðŸ˜‰


#### 3. Behance

For some of you who don't know what Behance is, Behance is a platform that allows people to share their work with the world. From motion graphics to photogrpahy, everything ca nbe shared. By following people, you can see what they like and like this you can discover new things along the way.

One thing I find very convenient on Behance are the collections. You can use it, just like Pinterest, to sort liked projects into different subjects. In this way, you can easily find something when you need some fresh inspiration.


#### 3. Siteinspire

Siteinspire is a showcase of beautiful (interactive) websites, just like [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com). Personally, I like Siteinspire more, because it's really about inspiration. I feel like Awwwards is more about receiving credit for your projects and getting feedback from others. But either way both are great inspirational sites.


#### 5. Pinterest
