Me and my boyfriend, Thibault, are two huge _plant ladies_. Thibault has made his own little jungle in his bedroom and I wanted to share some of his plants with you.

The left and middle plants are St. Bernard Lily's, often also called spider plants *[Chlorophytum comosum]*. Spiderplants are easy to slip. If you take good care of this plant, it will create a lot of spiderettes (cuttings), which you can slip and plant somewhere else. In no time you can have like 5 spider plants!

On the right side, you can see a teeny tiny cactus, I believe it's a barrel cactus, but I'm not sure.

No idea which plant this is, a pencil cactus maybe? But I absolutely love the vase. Also, take a look at that tiny crocodile!

Who can find the elephant? This is my favourite plant of all times, the calathea. The Calathea is also called the living plant, because it's following the rhythm of the day. At night, it closes its leaves to open them again in the morning. A-ma-zing. It can sometimes even cause a rustling sound.

Calathea's are beautiful, but beauty comes with a prices! They're really difficult to keep because of their origin. Because Calathea's are originally from the South-American jungle, they love humid places. So coming here, in cold and rainy Belgium, it needs a lot of water and indirect sunlight to survive. Not the ideal plant for someone without green fingers!

This last plant, was a gift from me to Thibault for his 21st birthday. It's a coffee plant which lives in its own hermetically sealed biotope. This means that this plant needs no external care because it recycles water and air on its own. Cool right? More info on these plants [here](https://pikaplant.com/)!
