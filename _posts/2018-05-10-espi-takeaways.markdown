If you‚Äôre expecting me to say ‚ÄúI learned German‚Äù or ‚ÄúI learned how to work with Jira‚Äù then you‚Äôre in the wrong place. This post is not a list of tools and software, but about experiences and lessons you don‚Äôt learn at university. Also I would like to state that these lessons are *totally subjective*, but I thought It was quite nice to share :)

### Working in a team

During university, I had multiple group assignments. I found them very helpful and interesting although now I see that in every group, there tended to be one leading-type who towed the project forward. This was mostly me, because -- you know -- I love to boss people around üòÇ All jokes aside, coming to Edenspiekermann and working in a team with two other designers (who are way more experienced than me) was something else than a team assignment at uni.

I learned that give and take is very important in every aspect. Also equality concerning the team members (whether they are a design director or a design intern) helps a lot for a good atmosphere. Equality within the team made me really feel at ease.

#### Gives:

##### 1. Give feedback.
 In a team it‚Äôs important to share opinions and give feedback on other people‚Äôs work. There were many times where I, as a design intern, asked feedback to my fellow teammates, but there were also times they asked me for feedback and I really appreciated that. It made me feel valued.

##### 2. Give up your ego.

This has not been a problem for me, nor have I seen it being a problem for anyone else, but I think it‚Äôs a very important takeaway. You‚Äôre not the only person in the team that will come up with solutions and sometimes your solution will just not be the better one. You will have to be able to deal with these kinds of situations and not let it get to you, because it‚Äôs not personally nor pointed directly at you. Also a very important reminder: Don‚Äôt take feedback personally. It‚Äôs not that your teammates despise you or value you less as a person because you made one shitty teaser.

Says enough. You can only do so much. When you do your ultimate best on something, you know it‚Äôs going to be worth it because you worked hard to get the final results. ‚ÄòDoing your best‚Äô doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Äúworking 24/7‚Äù in my opinion. For me doing your best means to have a productive day not quantity-wise, but definitely *quality wise*.

#### Takes:

##### 1. Take in feedback
A very imporant way to learn is to take in feedback properly. I‚Äôve mentioned this before in this article but one way or another you will get feedback sometime and you will have to learn how to take it. Fortunately for me, I was already used on getting feedback on my designs in university. When given feedback, my tip is not to blindly change everything, but to think about it first. If you don‚Äôt understand where the feedback is coming or why it is like this, ask again. Understanding is key and will make you a better designer. Also the other person might be just giving suggestions, it‚Äôs up to you to create the best outcome possible, not to do what the other person said.

##### 2. Take your time, quick and dirty does not always do it
I was very lucky to be put on a project that started when I arrived at Edenspiekermann. Within this project they really took the time to tackle everything. I thought this was interesting because they really gave me time to come up with a proper solution. I learned a lot by reading articles about UX-patterns online and implementing their suggestions into my own designs. Also, they handed me loads of time to explore different styles or make alternative components etc. which was super nice. Taking time, if possible, is a good thing to do, because you can spend attention to important details and your work is going to end up much more refined than a quick and dirty website. However, in some cases quick and dirty might just do fine ;)

##### 3. Take time to ask questions, dare to speak up and show that you‚Äôre eager to learn.
Daring to speak up is also something I‚Äôve learned. When you‚Äôre doing an internship you have to ask questions to learn. In general, you learn more through asking than sitting at your computer wasting hours trying to figure this tiny thing out because you‚Äôre too afraid to ask. The people there do realise that you‚Äôre an intern and your task is to learn, so they won‚Äôt judge you for dumb-ish questions :)

Speaking up in the way of expressing your likes and dislikes is also a good thing to do. From what I‚Äôve heard, if the people that you‚Äôre working with know what you‚Äôd like to do or what you‚Äôre really good at, they‚Äôll let you do it. If you don‚Äôt express any interest, you can end up cleaning Sketch files all day or preparing Keynotes. Fortunately, I had no problems with this whatsoever.

But the final and most important takeaway is: **Don‚Äôt be an asshole.** I met a lot of cool people during my internship and I'm glad to call some of them my friends now.


Well that‚Äôs it. I think I covered the most important takeaways with this post, at least for me. Also, my internship hasn‚Äôt ended yet, so I‚Äôm sure I will learn a lot more things.

<br/>


For the ones still looking for that particular list:

- I learned to work with a version management system like Github but for design files. Really interesting, but sometimes a pain in the ass.
- I learned a lot UX-wise, as the project I‚Äôm working on is really content heavy and meant for big target group.
- My German really improved üòù Guten Tag!
- I learned how to make proper quiches. üëåüèª
- I learned how to implement an RSS feed into a Slack channel üëçüèª
- What the hell, I also finally got used to working with a magic mouse, external iMac screen and an external Keyboard. Am I a true designer now?
- I am a part-time ping pong professional and have a really mean backhand (part-time because it‚Äôs only when I‚Äôm playing with the good bat)
