Inspired by [Thibault's post](https://blog.thibmaekelbergh.be/post/thank-you) from when he graduated, I also wanted to thank the people that stood by me throughout my studies.

My Devine career went pretty smoothly. I graduated in 3 years, no need to retake exams, no need to do-over a complete year. You could say it's all luck, but I worked my ass off the whole way. But I couldn't have done it without your support. Oh by the way, this post has no particular order, because it would not be fair to rate people.

#### Mom, Dad & Sofie

I know you didn't always believe in me, because I showed no deep interest in arts/design in my teeny-bop years, but still I want to thank you to support my decision to study it. Thank you for letting me do what I wanted to do. Also thanks for putting up with my outbursts when something went wrong just before a major deadline.

<br/>

#### Thibault Maekelbergh

At first you were a distraction to my work, but luckily that changed after a while. Thank you for pushing me to the limits of my capability. You made me into my best self and taught me that it's ok to not be good at everything.

<br/>

#### My Ex-Boyfriend

You once told me that studying Devine was really hard. Especially Back-End Development in the first year, because you were a first year at the time. Then you said, **"If I can't do it, why should you be able to do it?"**. And I want to thank you for that, because this motivated me to prove you wrong, and I did ;-)

<br/>


#### My Teachers

For teaching me what I learned the past 3 years, and for being there when I had questions about literally anything. The thing that attracted me to Devine the most — besides the awesome work of course — was the hands-on learning environment and the personal approach. Thanks for being awesome!

#### Nele De Bruycker

I know I haven't always been the easiest to work with, but thank you for putting up with me during all those assignments. I think we make a pretty good team. I also want to thank you for being the only really good friend I've had in college and I think that deserves a medal.

<br/>

#### Daniel Tibi & Silke Krieg

Thanks for sharing your knowledge with me and giving me the chance to grow. It was a pleasure working with you. You made my internship at Espi a wonderful experience that I will forever cherish.

<br/>

#### Giulia Ponzetta

Thank you for making my time in Berlin less lonely. I really admire your spontaneity and cheerfulness. I wish you all the best in your future career and I'm sure we will meet again!

<br/>

#### Giulia, Martina, Chris, Philippe, Tommy, Marcel, Joana, Tom, Nicoletta, Francesco, Lex, Franck, Kevin, Sergej, Amber

Wow, thank you all for putting up with me! I really enjoyed being around you and — obviously — playing Chinese ping-pong games. Working within such an international company is so cool because you get to meet so many different kinds of people, with different ideas and mindsets and I admired that about every single one of you. Truly going to miss you and if you ever find yourself in Belgium. Don't hesitate to give me a call.

<br/>


> *I can't mention everyone of course, so don't think I'm forgetting about you, but if you're reading this: Thank you!*
